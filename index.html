      <h2>What this is (really)</h2>
      <p>This started as a layout test. Then it became a small rebellion against everything I usually see online.</p>
      <p>No popups, sliders, testimonials in italics. Just HTML and CSS.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="top-right">
      <h2>Does this make sense?</h2>
      <p>Maybe. Maybe not. But at least it’s not another card grid with drop shadows.</p>
      <p>Every section here is mostly just me seeing how it feels to write without trying to market something.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="center-hero">
      <h1>This is a landing page</h1>
      <p>It doesn’t scream at you. It’s not trying to convert you. It just exists.</p>
      <a href="#bottom-right" id="primary-button">Click if you feel like it</a>

    <section id="bottom-left">
      <h2>Technical-ish bits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No classes, only ids. Because why not.</li>
        <li>Mobile-first. Because desktop-only layouts feel weird in 2026.</li>
        <li>No JS yet. Might not need it. Might add some for fun.</li>
        <li>Tested in 2 browsers. Good enough.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="bottom-right">
      <h2>This is the "Call to Action" I guess</h2>
      <p>If you scrolled all the way here, I feel like we’ve bonded a bit.</p>
      <p>There’s no form. No funnel. No pitch. Just this button.</p>
      <a href="#" id="cta-button">Okay then</a>
